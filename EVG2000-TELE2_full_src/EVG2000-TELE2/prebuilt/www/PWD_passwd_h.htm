<h1>Set Password Help</h1> 
<p>
	You use the <i>Set Password</i> page to change the password you use to access the <i>Settings</i> pages -- NOT your ISP account password. 
<p>
	To change the password: 
<ol>
	<li>
		Type the old password. 
		<BR>The default password for the router is: password. 
	<li>
		Type a new password and type it again in the <b>Repeat New Password</b> box to confirm it. 
		<br>
		<b>Note:</B> Be sure to write it down in a secure location. 
	<li>
		Click <b>Apply</b> to have the password changed or click <b>Cancel</b> to keep the current password. 
</ol>
<p>
	<b>Note:</b> If you have backed up the router settings previously, you should do a new backup so that the settings file includes the new password.
