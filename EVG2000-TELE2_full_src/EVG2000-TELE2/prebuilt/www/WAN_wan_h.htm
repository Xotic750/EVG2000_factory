<h1>WAN Setup Help </h1> 
<p>Using this page, you can set up several parameters related the the WAN connection.</p>

<a name="dod"></a>
<p><b>Connect Automatically, as Required</b>
</p><p>This option just can act when ppp is not set to be always on line.Normally, this option should be Enabled, so that an Internet
connection will be made automatically, whenever Internet-bound traffic
is detected. If this causes high connection costs, you can disable this
setting. <br>If disabled, you must connect manually, using the sub-screen accessed from the "Connection Status" button on the <b>Status</b> screen.</p>
<p>If you have an "Always on" connection, this setting has no effect.</p>

<a name="spi"></a>
<p><b>Disable Port Scan and DoS Protection</b> - The Firewall protects
your LAN against Port Scans and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. This
should be disabled only in special circumstances.</p>

<a name="ping"></a>
<p><b> Respond To Ping On Internet Port </b>
</p><p> If you want the EVG2000 to respond to a 'Ping' from the
Internet, click this check box. This can be used as a diagnostic tool.
This can be a security problem. You shouldn't check this box unless you
have a specific reason to do so. </p>

<a name="mtu"> </a>
<p><b>MTU Size</b>
</p><p>The normal MTU (Maximum Transmit Unit) value for most Ethernet
networks is 1500 Bytes, or 1492 Bytes for PPPoE connections. For some
ISPs you may need to reduce the MTU. But this is rarely required, and
should not be done unless you are sure it is necessary for your ISP
connection.</p>
