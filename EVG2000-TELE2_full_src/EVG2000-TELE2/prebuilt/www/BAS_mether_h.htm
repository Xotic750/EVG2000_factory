<h1>Help </h1>
<p>The EVG2000 Settings pages allow you to configure, upgrade and check the status of your NETGEAR Router. 

<p>Click an item in the leftmost column. The current settings or information for that area appear in the center column. 

<p>Helpful information related to the selected Settings page appears in this column. If you are using Internet Explorer, you may click an item in the center column to jump directly to the related help section; otherwise, scroll down until you reach it.

<p><h1>Basic Settings Help</h1>
<p><b>Note:</b> If you are setting up the Router for the first time, the default settings may work for you with no changes. 

<p><a name="question"></a><b>Does Your Internet Connection Require A Login?</b> 
<p>Select this option based on the type of account you have with your ISP. If you need to enter login information every time you connect to the Internet or you have a PPPoE account with your ISP, select <b>Yes</b>. Otherwise, select <b>No</b>. 

<p><b>Note: </b>If you have installed PPP software such as WinPoET (from Earthlink) or Enternet (from PacBell), then you have PPPoE. Select <b>Yes</b>. After selecting Yes and configuring your Router, you will not need to run the PPP software on your PC to connect to the Internet. </p>

<p><a name="accountname"></a><b>Account Name </b>
<p>(also known as Host Name or System Name) 

<p>For most users, type your account name or user name in this box. For example, if your main mail account is JerAB@ISP.com, then put JerAB in this box. 

<p>If your ISP has given you a specific Host name, then type it (for example, CCA7324-A). 

<p><a name="Domain"></a><b>Domain Name </b>
<p>For most users, you may leave this box blank, unless required by your ISP. You may type the domain name of your ISP. For example, if your ISP's mail server is mail.xxx.yyy.zzz, you would type xxx.yyy.zzz as the Domain Name. 

<p>If you have a Domain name given to you by your ISP, type it in this box. (For example,  Earthlink Cable may require a Host name of 'home' and Comcast sometimes supplies a Domain name.) 


<p><a name="InternetIP"></a><b>Internet IP Address </b>
<p>If you log in to your service or your ISP did not provide you with a fixed IP address, the Router will find an IP address for you automatically when you connect. Select <b>Get Dynamically From ISP</b>. 

<p>If you have a fixed (or static IP) address, your ISP will have provided you with the required information. Select <b>Use Static IP Address</b> and type the IP Address, Subnet Mask and Gateway IP Address into the correct boxes. 

<p>For example: 

<ul><li>      IP Address: 24.218.156.183 

<li>      Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 

<li>      Gateway IP Address: 24.218.156.1 

</ul>

<p><a name=DNSaddress></a><b>DNS Address </b>
<p>The DNS server is used to look up site addresses based on their names. 

<p>If your ISP gave you one or two DNS addresses, select <b>Use These DNS Servers </b>and type the primary and secondary addresses. 

<p>Otherwise, select <b>Get Automatically From ISP</b>. 

<p><b>Note:</b> If you get 'Address not found' errors when you go to a Web site, it is likely that your DNS servers aren't set up properly. You should contact your ISP to get DNS server addresses. </p>


<p><a name="nat"></a><b>NAT (Network Address Translation)</b>
<p>NAT allows all LAN PCs to gain Internet access via this Router, by sharing this Router's WAN IP address. In most situations, NAT is essential for Internet access via this Router. You should only disable NAT if you are sure you do not require it. When NAT is disabled, only standard routing is performed by this Router. Disabling the Firewall will change the default incoming rule from "Block" to "Allow",so the protections normally provided by the firewall will be disabled. Protections against DoS attacks and Port Scans will still be enabled and can be modified in the WAN Setup page. </p>


<p><a name=localaddress></a><b>Router MAC Address </b>
<p>Your computer's local address is its unique address on your network. This is also referred to as the computer's MAC (Media Access Control) address. 

<p>Usually, select Use Default MAC Address. 

<p>If your ISP requires MAC authentification, then select either <b>Use Computer MAC address </b>to disguise the Router's MAC address with the Computer's own MAC address or <b>Use This MAC Address</b> to manually type the MAC address for a different computer.  The format for the MAC address is XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX. This value may be changed if the <b>Use Computer MAC Address</b> is selected once a value has already been set in the  <b>Use This MAC Address</b> selection. </p>




<p><b>Apply, Cancel and Test</b>
<p>Click <b>Apply</b> when you finish changing the settings. 

<p>Click <b>Cancel</b> to return to the original settings. 

<p>Click <b>Test</b> to connect to the NETGEAR Web site. If you connect successfully, your settings work and you may click <b>Logout</b> to exit these pages and... enjoy surfing the <b>'net'! </b>

<p>If you don't connect successfully, 

<ul><li>      Go through the settings and make sure you've selected the correct options and typed everything correctly. 

<li>      Contact your ISP to verify the configuration information. 

<li>      Read the Troubleshooting section in the EVG2000 Installation Guide.

<li>      On the EVG2000 Resource CD, read the Troubleshooting Guide or the Troubleshooting section in the Reference Manual.

<li>     Contact NETGEAR Technical Support.
