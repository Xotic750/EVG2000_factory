<h1 class="helpfile">Outbound Service Help</h1> 
<p>You can use this screen to define a new Outbound Firewall rule, or edit an existing rule.
Outbound Firewall rules are used to block or allow access by computers on your network 
to services or applications on the Internet.
</p>
<a name="serv"> </a>
<p><b>Service</b>
<br>Select the desired Service or application to be covered by this rule. 
If the desired service or application does not appear in the list, you must define it using 
the Services menu.
<a name="action"> </a>
<p><b>Action</b>
<br>Select the desired action for packets covered by this rule:
<ul>
<li>BLOCK always
<li>BLOCK by schedule, otherwise Allow
<li>ALLOW always
<li>ALLOW by schedule, otherwise Block
</ul>
Note:
<ul>
 <li>Any outbound traffic which is not blocked by rules you create will be allowed by the Default rule.
 <li>ALLOW rules are only useful if the traffic is already covered by a BLOCK rule. 
(That is, you wish to allow a subset of traffic which is currently blocked by another rule.)
 <li>To define the Schedule used in these selections, use the "Schedule" screen.
</ul>

<a name="source"></a>
<p><B>LAN users</b>
<BR>These settings determine which computers on your network are affected by this rule, 
based on their source (LAN) IP address. Select the desired option:
<ul>
	<li>Any - All local IP addresses are covered by this rule.
	<li>Address range - If this option is selected, you must enter the "Start" and "Finish" fields.
	<li>Single address - Enter the required address in the "Start" fields.
</ul>

<a name="dest"></a>
<p><b>WAN Servers</b>
<BR>These settings determine which Internet locations are covered by the rule, based on their d
estination (WAN) IP address. Select the desired option:
<ul>
	<li>Any - All Internet IP address are covered by this rule.
	<li>Address range - If this option is selected, you must enter the "Start" and "Finish" fields.
	<li>Single address - Enter the required address in the "Start" fields.
</ul>

<a name="log"></a>
<p><b>Log</b>
<br>This determines whether packets covered by this rule are logged. Select the desired action:
<ul>
<li>Always - always log traffic considered by this rule, whether it matches or not. (This is useful when debugging your rules.)
<li>Never - never log traffic considered by this rule, whether it matches or not.
<li>Match - Log traffic only it matches this rule. (The action is determined by this rule.)
<li>Not Match - Log traffic which is considered by this rule, but does not match (The action is NOT determined by this rule.)
