<li>On the "Rules" screen, create the required Rules, using either "Block by Schedule" or "Allow by Schedule" for each rule, as required.
<li>Select the <b>Use this schedule for rules</b> checkbox on this screen.</li>
<li>Select the days and times on this screen, as required.
<li>Click <b>Apply</b>.</li>
</ol>

<a name="days"></a><h2 class="helpfile">Days</h2>
<p>Select the required days
<ul>
 <li>Every Day - all days will automatically be selected
 <li>Sunday, Monday .. &nbsp; If "Every Day" is NOT selected, you can choose the required days
 individually.
 </ul>


<a name="tod"></a><h2 class="helpfile">Time of day</h2>

<p>The Router will determine the current time and date by contacting a Network Time (NTP) Server on the Internet. In order to display your local time, you must select your <b>Time Zone</b> from the list.</p>
<p>If your region uses Daylight Savings Time, you must manually check <b>Adjust for Daylight Savings Time</b> at the beginning of the adjustment period, and uncheck it at the end of the Daylight Savings period.</p>

<p>Use this NTP Server
<br>If you prefer to use a particular NTP server as the primary server, check the checkbox <b>Use this NTP Server</b> and enter the Server's IP address under <b>Use this NTP Server</b>.
<p>If this setting is not enabled, the default NTP Servers are used.</p>
