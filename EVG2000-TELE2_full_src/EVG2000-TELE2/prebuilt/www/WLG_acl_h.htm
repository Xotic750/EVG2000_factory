Wireless Card Access List Help
</h1>
<p>By default, any wireless PC that is configured with the correct SSID will be allowed access to your wireless network. For increased security, you can restrict access to the wireless network to only allow specific PCs based on their MAC addresses. 
<p>The <b>Wireless Card Access Setup</b> page displays a list of wireless PCs that will be
allowed to connect to the router based on their MAC addresses. These wireless PCs must also have the correct SSID
and WEP settings configured on the <i>Wireless Settings</i> page to access the wireless network.
