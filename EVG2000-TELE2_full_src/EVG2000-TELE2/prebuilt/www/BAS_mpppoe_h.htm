<h1>Basic Settings Help</h1>
<p><b>Note:</b> If you are setting up the router for the first time, the default settings may work for you with no changes. 


<p><a name=question></a><b>Does Your Internet Connection Require A Login?</b> 
<p>Select this option based on the type of account you have with your ISP. If you need to enter login information every time you connect to the Internet or you have a PPPoE account with your ISP, select <b>Yes</b>. Otherwise, select <b>No</b>. </p>

<p><b>Note: </b>If you have installed PPP software such as WinPoET (from Earthlink) or Enternet (from PacBell), then you have PPPoE. Select Yes. After selecting Yes and configuring your router, you will not need to run the PPP software on your PC to connect to the Internet. </p>


<a name="isp"></a>
<h2 class="helpfile">Internet Service Provider</h2>
<p>Select the service provided by your ISP. "PPPoE" is the most common.</p>


<h2 class="helpfile"><a name="login"></a>Login </h2>

<p>This is usually the name that
you use in your e-mail address. For example, if your main mail account is
JerAB@ISP.com, then put JerAB in this box. </p>

<p>Some ISPs (like Mindspring, Earthlink, and T-DSL) require that you use your full e-mail address when you log in. If your ISP requires your full e-mail address, then type it in the Login box. </p>
<a name="password"></a>
<h2 class="helpfile">Password</h2>

<p>Type the password that you use
to log in to your ISP. </p>
<a name="serv_name"></a>
<h2 class="helpfile">Service Name</h2>

<p>If your ISP provided a Service Name, enter it here. Otherwise, this may be left blank.</p>

<a name="idletime"></a>
<h2 class="helpfile">Idle Timeout</h2>
<p>An idle Internet connection will be terminated after this time period.
<p>If this value is zero (0), then the connection will be "kept alive" by re-connecting immediately whenever the connection is lost.</p>

<a name="InternetIP"></a>
<h2 class="helpfile">Internet IP Address </h2>
<p>If you log in to your service or your ISP did not provide you with a fixed IP 
address, the router will find an IP address for you automatically when you connect. 
Select <b>Get dynamically from ISP</b>. </p>

<p>If you have a fixed (static, permanent) IP address, your ISP will have provided you 
with an IP address. Select <b>Use static IP address</b> and type in the IP Address. </p>

<a name=DNSaddress></a>
<h2 class="helpfile">Domain Name Server (DNS)
Address </h2>

<p>The DNS server is used to look
up site addresses based on their names. </p>

<p>If your ISP gave you one or two
DNS addresses, select <b>Use These DNS Servers </b>and type the primary and
secondary addresses. </p>

<p>Otherwise, select <b>Get
Automatically From ISP</b>. </p>

<p><b>Note: </b>If you get
'Address not found' errors when you go to a Web site, it is likely that your
DNS servers aren't set up properly. You should contact your ISP to get DNS
server addresses. </p>

<p><a name="nat"></a><b>NAT (Network Address Translation)</b>
<p>NAT allows all LAN PCs to gain Internet access via this Router, by sharing this Router's WAN IP address. In most situations, NAT is essential for Internet access via this Router. You should only disable NAT if you are sure you do not require it. When NAT is disabled, only standard routing is performed by this Router. Disabling the Firewall will change the default incoming rule from "Block" to "Allow",so the protections normally provided by the firewall will be disabled. Protections against DoS attacks and Port Scans will still be enabled and can be modified in the WAN Setup page. </p>


<h2 class="helpfile"><a name="buttons"> </a>Apply,
Cancel and Test Buttons</h2>

<p>Click <b>Apply</b> when you
finish changing the settings. </p>

<p>Click <b>Cancel</b> to return
to the original settings. </p>

<p>Click <b>Test</b> to connect to
the NETGEAR Web site. If you connect successfully, your settings work and you
may click <b>Logout</b> to exit these pages and... enjoy surfing the <b>'net'!</b>
</p>


<p>If you don't connect successfully, </p>
<ul>
<li>Go through the settings and make sure you've selected the correct options and typed everything correctly. </li>
<li>Contact your ISP to verify the configuration information. </li>
