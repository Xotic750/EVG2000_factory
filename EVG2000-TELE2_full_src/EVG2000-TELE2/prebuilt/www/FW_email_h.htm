<p>
Your Router can periodically email you the system log. (On the <i>Logs</i> screen, you can choose what events are to be included in the log.)
The Router can also send an immediate alert when it detects a significant security incident such as
<ul>
<li>A known hacker attack is directed at your IP address</li>
<li>A computer on the Internet scans your IP address for open ports</li>  
<li>Someone on your LAN (Local Area Network) tries to visit a blocked site.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you'd like to have alerts and logs sent to you by e-mail, fill out the settings on this form.</p>


<p>
You can always check the logs manually by viewing the <i>Logs</i> page. If you don't want to receive e-mails, simply leave the <b>Turn e-mail notification on</b> checkbox unchecked.

<h2 class="helpfile">Send alerts and logs by e-mail</h2>
<p>To receive alerts and logs by e-mail:
<ol>
<li>Select the <b>Turn E-mail Notification On</b> check box above.</li>
<li>In the <b>Send To This E-mail Address</b> box, type the e-mail address where the alerts and logs will be sent. Use a full e-mail address (for example, ChrisXY@myISP.com). 
</li>
<li>In the  <b>Outgoing Mail Server</b> box, type the name or IP address of the outgoing SMTP mail server of your ISP (for example, mail.myISP.com). 
<br>If you leave this box blank, no alerts or logs will be sent to you.
<li>Check <b>My Mail Server requires authentication</b> if you need to "login" to your SMTP Server in order to send E-mail. If this is checked, you must enter the user name and password for the Mail Server.
<br><b>Tip:</b> You used this information when you set up your e-mail program. If you can't remember it, check the settings in your e-mail program.</li>
</ol>
