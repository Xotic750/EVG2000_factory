<p>You can use this screen to define a new Inbound Firewall rule, or edit an existing rule.
Firewall rules can be used to block or allow specific traffic. <B>This feature is for Advanced Administrators only!</b> Incorrect configuration will cause serious problems.
</p>
<a name="serv"> </a>
<p><b>Service</b>
<br>Select the desired Service. This determines which packets are covered by this rule. If necessary, you can define a new Service on the "Services" screen, by defining the protocols and port numbers used by the Service.
<a name="action"> </a>
<p><b>Action</b>
<br>Select the desired action for packets covered by this rule:
<ul>
<li>ALLOW always
<li>ALLOW by schedule, otherwise Block
<li>BLOCK always
<li>BLOCK by schedule, otherwise Allow
</ul>
Note:
<ul>
 <li>Any inbound traffic which is not allowed by rules you create will be blocked by the Default rule.
 <li>BLOCK rules are only useful if the traffic is already covered by an ALLOW rule. (That is, you wish to block a sub-set of traffic which is currently allowed by another rule.)
<li>To define the Schedule used in these selections, use the "Schedule" screen.
</ul>

<a name="dest"></a>

	<li>Single address &nbsp; &nbsp; Enter the required address in the "Start" fields.
</ul>

<a name="log"></a>
<p><b>Log</b>
<br>This determines whether packets covered by this rule are logged. Select the desired action.
<ul>
<li>Always - always log traffic considered by this rule, whether it matches or not. (This is useful when debugging your rules.)
<li>Never - never log traffic considered by this rule, whether it matches or not.
<li>Match - Log traffic only it matches this rule. (The action is determined by this rule.)
<li>Not Match - Log traffic which is considered by this rule, but does not match (The action is NOT determined by this rule.)
