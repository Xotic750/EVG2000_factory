<p>
	You can use this page to perform various diagnostics. For normal operation, these are not required.</p>


<a name="ping"></a>
<p><b>Ping an IP address</b>
<BR>
Use this to send a "ping" packet request to the specified IP address. This is often used to test a connection. If the request "times out" (no reply is received), this usually means the destination is unreachable.
<br>However, some network devices can be configured not to respond to a ping.</p>


<a name="dnslookup"></a>
<p><b>Perform a DNS Lookup</b>
<BR>
A DNS (Domain Name Server) converts the Internet name (e.g. www.netgear.com) to an IP address. If you need the IP address of a Web, FTP, Mail or other Server on the Internet, you can do a DNS lookup to fing the IP address.</p>


<a name="rtable"></a>
<p><b>Display the Routing Table</b>
<BR>This operation will display the internal routing table. This information is used by Technical Support and other staff who understand Routing Tables.</p>


<a name="reboot"></a>
<p><b>Reboot the Router</b>
<BR>Use this button to perform a remote reboot (restart). You can use this if the Router seems to have become unstable or is not operating normally.</p>

<p><b>Note</b> &nbsp; Rebooting will break any existing connections either to the Router (such as this one) or through the Router (for example, LAN users accessing the Internet). However, connections to the Internet will automatically be re-established when possible.</p>
