<P>Enable Wireless Router Radio 
<P>The Wireless Access Point Router of this router can be enabled or disabled to 
allow wireless access. The wireless icon on the front of the router will also 
display the current status of the Wireless Access Point to let you know if it 
is disabled or enabled. If Enabled, wireless stations will be able to access the 
Internet. If Disabled, wireless stations will not be able to access the 
Internet.</P> 
<P>Enable SSID Broadcast
<P>If Enabled, the Wireless RouterSSID will broadcast its name (SSID) to all 
Wireless Stations. Stations which have no SSID (or a "null" value) can then 
adopt the correct SSID for connections to this Access Point.</P>
<P>Fragmentation Threshold, CTS/RTS Threshold, Preamble Mode
<P>These settings are reserved for wireless testing and advanced configuration 
only. Do not change these settings.</P>

<P><B>108Mbps Settings</B></P>
<P>Disable Advanced 108Mbps Features
<P>If Disabled, the Wireless Router will disable data compression, packet 
bursting and large frame support.</P>
<P>Enable eXtended Range
<P>Enable eXtended Range - eXtended Range (XR) Technology provides 
significantly longer range than basic 802.11 by maintaining connectivity when 
signals are made faint when passing through dense walls, floors, or other 
barriers. XR products require no additional configuration by end-users and are 
fully interoperable with standard 802.11 technologies.</P>

<P><B>Wireless Card Access List</B></P>
<P>By default, any wireless PC that is configured with the correct SSID will be 
allowed access to your wireless network. For increased security, you can 
restrict access to the wireless network to only allow specific PCs based on 
their MAC addresses. From the Wireless Settings menu, click the Setup Access 
List button to display the Wireless Access List menu.</P>
