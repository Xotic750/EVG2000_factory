 <h1>Wireless Settings Help</h1>
 
<p><b>NOTE:</b> To ensure proper agency compliance and compatibility between similar products in your area; the operating channel &amp; region must be set correctly by you.
<p>Placement of the Router to Optimize Wireless Connectivity
<p>The operating distance or range of your wireless connection can vary significantly based on the physical placement of the Router. For best results, place your Router:

<ul><li>       Near the center of the area in which your PCs will operate,

<li>      In an elevated location such as a high shelf,

<li>       Away from potential sources of interference, such as PCs, microwaves, and cordless phones,


<li>     Away from large metal surfaces.
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b>  Failure to follow these guidelines can result in significant performance degradation or inability to wirelessly connect to the Router.</p>

<a name="network"></a>
<p><b>Wireless Network</b></p>
<p>Name (SSID)
<p>
Enter a value of up to 32 alphanumeric characters. The same Name (SSID) must be assigned to all wireless devices in your network. The default SSID is NETGEAR, but NETGEAR strongly recommends that you change your networks Name (SSID) to a different value. This value is also case-sensitive. For example, <i>Wireless</i> is not the same as <i>wireless</i>.
<p>
Region 
<p>
Select your region from the drop-down list.  This field displays the region of operation for which the wireless interface is intended. It may not be legal to operate the Router in a region other than the region shown here.  If your country or region is not listed, please check with your local government agency or check our website for more information on which channels to use. 
<p>
Channel 
<p>This field determines which operating frequency will be used. It should not be necessary to change the wireless channel unless you notice interference problems with another nearby access point.<p>


<p>Mode 
<p>Select the desired wireless mode. The options are:
<ul>
  <LI>Up to 54 Mbps - Legacy Mode with maximum speed of up to 54 Mbps for b/g networks.
  <LI>Up to 130 Mbps - Neighbor Friendly Mode - Default speed up to 130 Mbps in presence of neighboring wireless networks.
  <LI>Up to 270 Mbps - Performance Mode - Maximum Wireless-N speed up to 270 Mbps.
</LI>
</ul>

<P>The default is "Up to 130Mbps", which allows all 11b and 11g wireless stations. The NETGEAR WN511B runs at 130 Mbps when accessing this router. </P>

<p><b>Wireless Access Point</b></p>

<p>Enable Wireless Access Point

<p> The Wireless Access Point of this Router can be enabled or disabled to allow wireless access. The wireless icon on the front of the Router will also display the current status of the Wireless Access Point to let you know if it is disabled or enabled.
<p>If Enabled, wireless stations will be able to access the Internet.<br> If Disabled, wireless stations will not be able to access the Internet.
<p>Allow Broadcast of Name (SSID)
<P>If Enabled, the SSID will broadcast its name to all Wireless Stations. Stations which have no SSID (or a "null" value) can then adopt the correct SSID for connections to this Access Point.</p>

<p>Wireless Isolation
<P>If Enabled, the Wireless Stations will be hidden from each other, and will not be able to communicate with each other. For normal situations, this setting should be left at the default value of <b>Disabled</b>.</p>

<hr>
<a name="access"></a>
<p><b>Wireless Station Access List</b></p>
<p>By default, any wireless PC that is configured with the correct SSID will be allowed access to your wireless network. For increased security, you can restrict access to the wireless network to only allow specific PCs based on their MAC addresses. From the <i>Wireless Settings</i> menu, click the <b>Setup Access List</b> button to display the Wireless Station Access List menu. </p>

<hr>
<a name="security"></a>
<P><b>Security Options</b>

<p>Select the desired option, and ensure all your Wireless stations have the same setting:
<ul>
<li>Disable - This will disable the security function. Data will not be encrypted before transmission.
<li>WEP - WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy), if used, encrypts data before transmission. This provides greater security and privacy.
All Wireless Stations need to use the same settings (WEP Key size and WEP key).
<LI>WPA-PSK [TKIP] - Wi-Fi Protected Access with Pre-Shared Key, use WPA-PSK standard encryption with TKIP encryption type
<LI>WPA2-PSK [AES] - Wi-Fi Protected Access version 2 with Pre-Shared Key, use WPA2-PSK standard encryption with the AES encryption type
<li>WPA-PSK [TKIP] + WPA2-PSK [AES] - Allow clients using either WPA-PSK [TKIP] or WPA2-PSK [AES]
</ul>


<hr>
<a name="wep"></a>
<p><b>WEP Security Encryption</b>
<p>Authentication Type

<p>Normally this can be left at the default value of "Automatic." If that fails, select the appropriate value - "Open System" or "Shared Key." Check your wireless card's documentation to see what method to use.

<p>Encryption Strength 
<p>Select the WEP Encryption level:
<ul>
<li>64-bit (sometimes called 40-bit) encryption
<li>128-bit encryption
</ul>

<a name="wepkey"></a>
<p><b>WEP Key</b></p>
<p>You can manually or automatically program the four data encryption keys. These values must be identical on all PCs and Access Points in your network.

<p>Automatic Key Generation (Passphrase)
<p>Enter a word or group of printable characters in the Passphrase box and click the Generate button to automatically configure the WEP Key(s). If encryption strength is set to 64 bit, then each of the four key boxes will automatically be populated with key values. If encryption strength is set to 128 bit, then only the selected WEP key box will automatically be populated with key values.

<p>Manual Entry Mode
<p>Select which of the four keys will be used and enter the matching WEP key information for your network in the selected key box.

<p>For 64 bit WEP - Enter ten hexadecimal digits (any combination of 0-9, A-F).
<p>For 128 bit WEP - Enter twenty-six hexadecimal digits (any combination of 0-9, A-F).
<p>Be sure to click Apply to save your settings in this menu.</p>

<a name="wpa-psk"></a>
<P><B>Security Encryption (WPA-PSK)</B></P>
<P>If selected, you must use TKIP encryption, and enter the WPA passphrase (Network key). Enter a word or group of printable characters in the Passphrase box. The
Passphrase must be constituted of either 8 to 63 ASCII characters or exactly 64 hex digits.
A hex digit is one of the following characters: 0, 1, 2, ..., 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F.
<P>Be sure to click Apply to save your settings. </p>
<HR>
<A name=wpa2-psk></A>
<P><B>Security Encryption (WPA2-PSK)</B></P>
<P>WPA2 is a newer version of WPA. Only select this if all the wireless clients in your network support WPA2. If selected, you must use AES encryption, and enter the WPA passphrase (Network key). 
Enter a word or group of printable characters in the Passphrase box. The
Passphrase must be constituted of either 8 to 63 ASCII characters or exactly 64 hex digits.
A hex digit is one of the following characters: 0, 1, 2, ..., 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F.
<HR>
<A name=wpa-psk+wpa2-psk></A>
<P><B>Security Encryption (WPA-PSK + WPA2-PSK)</B></P>
<P>This selection allows clients to use either WPA (with TKIP, broadcast packets also use TKIP.) or WPA2 (with AES). If selected, encryption must be TKIP + AES. The WPA passphrase (Network key) must also be entered. To reach maximum wireless performance, the client like WN511B must connect to this router using WPA2(with AES) .  For clients connecting in WPA-PSK( with TKIP), the maximum wireless speed will be at 802.11g.
Enter a word or group of printable characters in the Passphrase box. The
Passphrase must be constituted of either 8 to 63 ASCII characters or exactly 64 hex digits.
A hex digit is one of the following characters: 0, 1, 2, ..., 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F.
