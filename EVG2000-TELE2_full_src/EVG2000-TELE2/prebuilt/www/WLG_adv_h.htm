<p>Router's PIN
<p>This is the PIN number you use on a registrar (e.g. from the Network Explorer on a Vista Windows PC) 
to configure the router's wireless settings through WPS. <BR>
You can also find the PIN on the router's product label too.

<p>Keep Existing Wireless Settings
<p>This shows whether the router is in the WPS Configured state.<br>
If the this option is not checked, adding a new wireless client will change the router's wireless
settings to an automacically generated random SSID and security key. Besides, if this option is checked,
some external registrar (e.g. Network Explorer on Vista Windows) may not see the router.<br>
Configuring basic wireless settings from the router's management GUI makes this option checked.
