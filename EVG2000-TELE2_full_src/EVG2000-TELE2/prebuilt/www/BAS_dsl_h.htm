<p>The default parameters should be correct to match the system used by your ISP</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Multiplexing Method - Your ISP will indicate whether your Multiplexing Method is VC-BASED or LLC-BASED.
      <li>Virtual Circuit - Your ISP will indicate which VPI/VCI combination is used for your service.
    </ul>
<p>Connection service guarantees are specified per ATM VPI/VCI by a set of measurable connection parameters.
Please check your ISP to set the proper parameters. If you don't know how to configure them, please keep them as default.
</p>
<ul>
      <li>UBR (Unspecified Bit Rate): The protocol that provides spare bandwidth to non-critical services such as file transfers. The actual rate depend on the bandwidth of the current network.

      <li>CBR(Constant Bit Rate): Real-time connection with a specified amount of guaranteed bandwidth (PCR) that is continuously available during the connection life-time. 

      <li>VBR-rt (Real-Time Variable Bit Rate): Similar as CBR intended for real-time applications with constrained delay and delay variation values, but which can benefit from variable bit-rates. The average guaranteed bandwidth is SCR, but data up to PCR may be sent for a limited amount of data specified by MBS. A VBR-rt connection is characterized by PCR, SCR, MBS. 


      <li>VBR-nrt (Non-Real-Time Variable Bit Rate): Intended for non-real-time applications that have bursty traffic characteristics and no strict transfer delay requirements but which require an amount of guaranteed bandwidth. A VBR-nrt connection is characterized by an average guaranteed bandwidth (SCR) up to a maximum guaranteed bandwidth (PCR) for a burst with specified maximum size (MBS).


      <li>PCR (Peak Cell Rate): Maximum number of ATM cells per second that may be sent on the connection.


      <li>SCR (Sustainable Cell Rate): Average number of ATM cells per second that may be sent on the connection.
      
      <li>MBS (Maximum Burst. Size): Maximum number of ATM cells that may be sent in a burst, and thus exceeding the average number of cells (SCR) up to the maximum number of cells (PCR) for a limited number of ATM cells defined by MBS.
