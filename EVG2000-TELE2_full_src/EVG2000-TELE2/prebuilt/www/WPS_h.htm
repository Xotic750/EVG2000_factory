WPS stands for Wi-Fi Protected Setup. This is a process that let you add a wireless client to the network
easily, and you don't have to specificly configure the wireless settings like SSID, security mode, and
passphrase.

<p>With the "Push Button" method, you have to complete the process by clicking a button on the client 
(either a hardware button or a software button on the client's utility GUI).
