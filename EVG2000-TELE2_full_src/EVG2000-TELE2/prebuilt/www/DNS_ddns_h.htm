<h1>Dynamic DNS Help</h1> 
<p>
	A Dynamic DNS (DDNS) Service provides a central public database where information (such as e-mail addresses, host names and IP addresses) can be stored and retrieved. The Dynamic DNS server also stores password-protected information and accepts queries based on e-mail addresses. 
</p>
<p>
	If you want to use a DDNS service, you must register for it. The Dynamic DNS client service provider will give you a password or key.

<p>
	To set up for DDNS:

<ol>
	<li>If you have registered with a DDNS service provider, select the <b>Use A Dynamic
        DNS Service</b> check box. 	</li>
		
	<li><a name="provider"></a>Select the name of your dynamic DNS <b>Service Provider</b>.&nbsp;	</li>
	<li>Type the <b>Host Name</b> that your dynamic DNS service provider gave you. 
		<br>The DDNS service provider may call this the domain name. </li>
	<li>Type the <b>User Name</b> for your DDNS account. </li>
	<li>Type the <b>Password</b> (or key) for your DDNS account. </li>
	<li>Click <b>Apply</b> to have the DDNS service used. 	</li>
</ol>
	
<p><b>Note:</b> The Router supports only basic DDNS and the login and password may not be secure. If you have a private WAN IP address, do not use DDNS service as it may lead to problems.
