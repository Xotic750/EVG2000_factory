<h1>Static Routes Help</h1> 
<p>
	Static routes give the router information that it cannot learn automatically through other means. This can happen when RIP is disabled on the LAN. (See the <i>LAN IP Setup</i> page.) All defined static routes appear in the table. To add or delete a route, work in the area under the Static Routes table.

	<b>To Set Up A Static Route:</b> 
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Click the <b>Add</b> button. 
	</li>

	<li>
		Type a route name for this static route in the <b>Route Name</b> box under the table.
		<br>
		(This is for identification purposes only.) 
	</li>
<li>
		Select <b>Private</b> if you want to limit access to the LAN only. 
	</li>


	<li>
		Select <b>Active</b> to make this route effective. 
	</li>
	<li>
		Type the <b>Destination IP Address</b> of the final destination. 
	</li>
	<li>
		Type the <b>IP Subnet Mask</b> for this destination. 
		<br>
		If this is for a single host, type 255.255.255.255. 
	</li>
	<li>
		Type the <b>Gateway IP Address</b>, which must be a router on the same segment. 
	</li>
	<li>
		Type a number between 2 and 15 as the <b>Metric</b> value. 
		<br>
		This represents the number of other routers on your network. Usually, setting this to 2 or 3 works the best, but if this is a direct connection, set it to 2.
