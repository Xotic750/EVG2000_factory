<h2 class="helpfile">Enable Wireless Repeating</h2>
<p>Enable this if you wish to use either Bridge mode or Repeater mode, and then select the desired  mode for your environment: 
    </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
    <a name="ptp"></a>
		<strong>Wireless Repeater</strong>
  <BR>In this mode, the EVG2000 will communicate ONLY with another Base Station-mode
  Wireless Station. You must enter the MAC address (physical address) of the
  other Base Station-mode Wireless Station in the field provided. WEP can (and should)
  be used to protect this communication. 
  
  </li>
   <a name="ptmp"></a>
   <li><strong>Wireless Base Station</strong>
	<BR>Select this only if this EVG2000 is the &quot;Master&quot; for a group of
    Repeater-mode Wireless Stations. The other Repeater-mode Wireless Stations must be
  set to <strong>Wireless Repeater</strong> mode, using this EVG2000's MAC
  address. They then send all traffic to this &quot;Master&quot;, rather than
  communicate directly with each other. WEP can (and should) be used to protect
  this traffic. 
  <BR>If selected, you must enter the MAC addresses of the other Access Points in the fields provided.
