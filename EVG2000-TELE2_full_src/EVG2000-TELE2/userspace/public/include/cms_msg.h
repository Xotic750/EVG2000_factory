/*!\file cms_msg.h
 * \brief Public header file for messaging.
 * Code which need to handle messages must include this file.
 *
 * Here is a general description of how to use this interface.
 *
 * Early in application startup code, call cmsMsg_init() with a pointer
 * to void *.
 *
 * To receive a message, call cmsMsg_receive().  This returns a
 * pointer to a buffer that has a CmsMsgHeader at the beginning
 * and optional data after the header.  Free this buffer when you
 * are done with it by calling cmsMsg_free().
 *
 * To send a message, allocate a buffer big enough to hold a
 * CmsMsgHeader and any optional data you need to send with the
 * message.  Fill in the buffer (header and data portion), and
 * call cmsMsg_send().
 *
 * Before the application exits, call cmsMsg_cleanup().
 */


/*!\enum CmsMsgType
 * \brief  Enumeration of possible message types
 *
 * This is the complete list of message types.
 * By convention:
 * system event message types are from            0x10000250-0x100007ff
 * system request/response message types are from 0x10000800-0x10000fff
 * Voice event messages are from                  0x10002000-0x100020ff
 * Voice request/response messages are from       0x10002100-0x100021ff
 * GPON OMCI request/response messages are from   0x10002200-0x100022ff
 * Note that a message type does not specify whether it is a
 * request or response, that is indicated via the flags field of
 * CmsMsgHeader.
