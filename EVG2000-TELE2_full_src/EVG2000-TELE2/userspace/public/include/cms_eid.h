/*!\file cms_eid.h
 * \brief Header file containing entity id assignments in
 * the CPE Management System (CMS).
 */


/*!\enum CmsEntityId
 * \brief Entity Id's (eid) are like process id's (pid), except they identify an
 * application in general, not the specific instance of that application.
 *
 * For example, the ppp application has an entity id of 22.  That entity id
 * refers to the ppp application in general, not a specific instance of ppp,
 * which is uniquely identified by its process id (pid).
 * 
 * Entity Id's are used by the various CMS API's to identify its caller.
 * They are also used by the messaging sub-system to identify the source
 * and destination of messages.  In most cases, there is only one instance
 * of a particular application, so specifying the CmsEntityId is enough to
 * identify the application.  However, for applications that may have multiple
 * instances, additional steps may be required.  (For details on how
 * to identify an application for the purpose of sending or receiving messages,
 * see cms_msg.h).
 *
 * Entity Id's and TR69 access bits are bound together by the entityInfoArray
 * in eid.c.  Entities that have TR69 access bits must be listed first.
 *
 * Any changes in this array must also be reflected in entityInfoArray in eid.c
