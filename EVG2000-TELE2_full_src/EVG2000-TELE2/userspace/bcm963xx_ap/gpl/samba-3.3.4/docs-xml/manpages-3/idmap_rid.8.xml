	<title>DESCRIPTION</title>
	<para>The idmap_rid backend provides a way to use an algorithmic
	mapping scheme to map UIDs/GIDs and SIDs. No database is required
	in this case as the mapping is deterministic.</para>

	<variablelist>
		<varlistentry>
		<term>range = low - high</term>
		<listitem><para>
			Defines the available matching uid and gid range for which the
			backend is authoritative. Note that the range acts as a filter.
			If algorithmically determined UID or GID fall outside the
			range, they are ignored and the corresponding map is discarded.
			It is intended as a way to avoid accidental UID/GID overlaps
			between local and remotely defined IDs.
		</para></listitem>
		</varlistentry>

		<varlistentry>
		<term>base_rid = INTEGER</term>
		<listitem><para>
			Defines the base integer used to build SIDs out of an UID or a GID,
			and to rebase the UID or GID to be obtained from a SID. User RIDs
			by default start at 1000 (512 hexadecimal), this means a good value
			for base_rid can be 1000 as the resulting ID is calculated this way:
			ID = RID - BASE_RID + LOW RANGE ID.
		</para>
		<para>
			Use of this parameter is deprecated.

	<para>
	The original Samba software and related utilities
	were created by Andrew Tridgell. Samba is now developed
	by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar
	to the way the Linux kernel is developed.
